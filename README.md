### Audio Playback 
To playback audio use the aux cable connected to the mixer board. The mixer board will allow you to adjust various parameters such as bass, treble, and such. You can also plug multiple inputs into this mixer board for more advanced setups such as using microphones or multiple sources for audio. There is also a headphone output on the mixer board to make it easier to hear the current playback. 

### Light Control
The lights used for this can be controlled through the QLC software and the USB controller. This was to allow for easier saving of configurations for parties. However, a hardwired controller can be used for ease of use if needed and can be daisy-chained into the system later on. The required config files and software are provided in the QLC+ subdirectory in this repository.
